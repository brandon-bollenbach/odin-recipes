# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to build a basic recipe website. Building the site will showcase the knowledge I have gainded so far using the Odin Project.
The specific skills being showcased include basic HTML to build the website and provide content as well as basic Git commands to commit changes to the project and eventually push it to Github for others to see.
