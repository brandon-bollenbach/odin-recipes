    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz. spaghetti or angel hair</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 c. diced tomatoes (fresh or canned)</li>
        <li>3 c. baby spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 c. heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/3 c. freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Freshly torn basil, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper and cook until golden and no longer 
            pink inside, about 8 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes, then thinly slice.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in same skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crispy, 8 minutes. Drain on a paper towel–lined plate, then chop. Pour 
            off half of fat from skillet.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, tomatoes, and spinach to skillet and cook over medium heat until fragrant and slightly wilted, 2 minutes. Season with salt 
            and pepper, then add heavy cream, Parmesan, and 1/2 cup of reserved pasta water. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta and toss until fully coated, then add chicken and bacon and toss until combined. (For a looser sauce, stir in more 
            reserved pasta water.)</li>
        <li>Garnish with basil before serving.</li>
    </ol>
